Simply hover over the toolbar at the top of the window to change fonts. When you're happy with the results, click the \"Use fonts\" link to haz teh codez.\r\n\r\n### Fontify on your site\r\nAs a jQuery plugin, Fontify requires ... jQuery. So, be sure to do something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"jquery.js\"></script>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" strc=\"jquery.fontify.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen you'll be able to use Fontify to preview fonts on your own site with some code like this:\r\n```\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n    $(document).ready(function() {\r\n        $('.headlines, p').fontify();\r\n    });\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### More about Fontify\r\nFontify is a jQuery plugin. It was developed against jQuery 1.8.3 and tested exclusively in Chromium 22.0.1229.94 on Ubuntu 12.10, so if you want to tell me about your troubles (which is welcome), be sure to include a bunch of information like that.\r\n\r\n### Thanks\r\nFontify uses [SimpleModal](https://github.com/ericmmartin/simplemodal), which is awesome. So thanks to [Eric Martin](https://github.com/ericmmartin) for that."}
